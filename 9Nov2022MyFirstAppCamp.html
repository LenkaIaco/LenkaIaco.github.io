In the end they get translated to unique sequences of 0s and 1s (number codes that are executable by the computer). Each character has its own number, unique to the CHARSET.
        UTF-8 is recommended to be used when programming as is very widespread. Its important to use the SAME encoding at every part of your website; once selected, use UTF all the way through until the website is finished. -->
        <style>
            /* <style> tag indicates that the code within is written in CSS not HTML anymore. So the program recognises it correctly. 
                For better orientation, especially when writting large amounts of code, it is however recommended to create a separate CSS file - create a new text file in VisualStudioCode, 
                and save it with ending .css - that means this text file contains CSS rules, and can be recognised as a CSS file when opened in VisualStudioCode 
                If you have the same html element styled in your css file and styled in your HTML file via style tag, the style tag in HTML overrides the CSS file styling. However,
                for orientation and efficiency purposes it is better to put all the css styling into css.*/

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style1.css"><!-- to link a separate CSS file to your html file, refer to it with the <link> tag as seen here. 
            Relative address: Our css file is saved in the same folder as our HTML file, therefore we refer to only the file name in the "address part"; the address path to the CSS file is same as the path of this HTML file 
            If the css file is in a folder "css" next to the html file on the computer, but they have the same parent folder, use still relative address, only enriched by the one extra folder that is different 
            in the address path of your CSS file, compared to the HTML file's address path: "styles/style.css"
            "./style.css" - the dot at the beginning is actually a computer "command line", telling to get the address path of the current folder.
            "../style.css" - two dots command line is telling to get not the most current the address path, but one-folder up, parent-folder-wise.
            Absolute address example: "http://example.com/style.css"
            Absolute address of this file in the folder(if inserted as a web browser's address, you can preview how your website will look like once it is on the web. Btw, the main purpose of browsers is to display htmls files.): file:///C:/laragon/www/adventure/MyFirstAppCampNov2022/9Nov2022MyFirstAppCamp.html
