      <!-- ATTENTION: the Live Server extension opens relative address links with your domain abbreviation reference + the relative reference inserted in <a href>. However, your domain 
        abbreviation works only if the relative reference's file is in the same folder as your currently opened folder in Visual Studio Code. If you want to check whether the relative 
        reference works, open your html file directly from your compurer folder in a web browser(instead of the Go Live command in VS Code), and then test the link by clicking on it. 
        After the link opens in the address browser window, you will have full file-address-path displayed in the address tab, instead of just the domain abbreviation.-->
      <!-- we are going to open file index.html in the folder .idea. This file is not in the same folder as our html file 16Nov, but we want to relative-refer using the location of 16Nov file
      using direct command .../ before stating the folder in which our desired index.html is stored means that the computer needs to search 3 folders up(go back via parent folders 3 times) and 
      then open the folder .idea, in which our index.html is stored. In general, a file called index.html is the default file to be loaded from any directory, so that is not necessary to
       write the file name after indicating its parent folder - we can skip to write it at the end of the relative address: /.index.html -->
