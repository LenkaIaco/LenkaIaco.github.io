   <h1>hello world!</h1>
   
   <!-- like with css files, you can either insert a JavaScript tag <script>with code inside</script> directly into html's <body>, or refer to a separate JS document, still in the 
    <body>(not in <head> like with css) using <script src="yourJSdocumentname.js"></script> .
    If u decide for <script> in <body>, put it as the very last entry of the <body> tag. Reason is, if making changes to HTML code and want to load and preview changes, if u have <script>
    at the beginning of <body>, it may take time until the actual HTML change loads, as the code is being executed from top to bottom.

    <script>
   let name = "Adam";
   "</script> 
-->


<script src="my-firstJS.js"></script>
</body>
